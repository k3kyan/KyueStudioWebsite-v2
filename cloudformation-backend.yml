# TODO: FIRST: USE AWS Toolkit for VS Code
# has support for
  # visualizing cloudformation templates
  # running SAM for local lambda testing // KINDA USEFUL LOOKING, ALSO ITS FREE !!! 
  # AUTHORING TEMPLATES WITH AUTOCOMPLETE + SNIPPETS !!!!!
# LATER: RESEARCH: maybe i can test my code with SAM after I deploy this raw to aws for the first time, since i dont wanna set up a whole SAM system right now. I can try after since bringing back the local-json-saving code would be a pain
