Service module
- database INTERACTIONS layer/module
- ex: crud, read write load save etc
- ex: i/o, json, db, etc
- contains for ex: load_fruits, save_fruits, etc


TODO: RESEARCH: Does the service module also interact with schemas? or is that conversion from schemas to models done elsewhere?
-- done in routes maybe??

- Handles writing to DB (ex: uses DB formatting from Models (which already took care of converting pydantic Schema format to DB Model (json) format)
Ex: loads data from file/db, saves data to file/db



1. schemas: pydantic models only
2. models: db model formatting + converting
3. services: use models to interact with DB (read, write, find, update, etc)



The service layer (also called the "business logic" or "application logic" layer) should be the 
ONLY 
part of your app that
DIRECTLY
interacts with the database or external storage !!!!!!!!!!!!


ONLY the service layer should touch the database
