Service module
- database INTERACTIONS layer/module
- ex: crud, read write load save etc
- ex: i/o, json, db, etc
- contains for ex: load_fruits, save_fruits, etc


TODO: RESEARCH: Does the service module also interact with schemas? or is that conversion from schemas to models done elsewhere?
-- done in routes maybe??

- Handles writing to DB (ex: uses DB formatting from Models (which already took care of converting pydantic Schema format to DB Model (json) format)
Ex: loads data from file/db, saves data to file/db
