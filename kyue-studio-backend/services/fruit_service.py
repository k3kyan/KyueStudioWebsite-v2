# data logic like loading from db, db persistance, etc
# This is where you interact with your database (TODO: RESEARCH: i think this is the ONLY file that should directly touch the database  ??? right ???)


# TODO: (RESEARCH LATER) tbh, not entirely sure if service is where this logic goes? makes sense tho but havent before
# should clean up for cleaner AWS migration replacement too
# Ig it makes sense that i put this in the service module since the SERVICE module handles logic, as practiced at work ... 

from pathlib import Path
import json
from models.fruit_models import FruitModel #TODO: FIX: is it models or schemas ???? I mean ig models is the JSON, not pydantic model, so makes sense ...? Since the schema-models conversion probably doesnt happen here...??
