Routes:
- Handles endpoint logic

Example use of endpoint methods 
1. take in API Pydantic Schema as a request body, 
2. which we then convert to JSON Models using the methods in the same json Models Module (i.e. to_schema() etc) #MODELS MODULE METHODS
3. Then we use the methods in the Service module to save that json model to the db (i.e. save_fruits() ) #SERVICE MODULE METHODS

Separation of Concerns:
- Routes/controllers:   handle HTTP logic (requests, responses, status codes).
- Services:             handle business rules, validation, and data persistence.
- Schemas/models:       define the shape of the data â€” not how it's stored or fetched.


separation of concerns allows easier read, debug, and test
You can mock the service layer in unit tests for routes.
