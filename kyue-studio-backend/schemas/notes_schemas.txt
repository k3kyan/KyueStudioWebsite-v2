Schemas: 
- Domain or database structures (your internal data formats)
- often matching tables, DynamoDB items, or stored JSON structure.

i.e.: PYDANTIC MODELS
- input/output shape
- API response/request body
- validation

- DOESNT CARE ABOUT PERSISTANCE FORMAT!!! (E.g. how its saved in DynamoDB, SQL, JSON, etc)
- Handles how data is used/formatted in the business logic, rather than storage or persistance/saving/writing/reading/etc
- cleaner to read i think?

usually API related, aka Pydantic models
Defines what the API expects as input (aka the request body)
Defines what the API returns as output (aka the response model)
Used for validation, serialization, and documentation
No DB relationships
